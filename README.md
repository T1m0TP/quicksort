# A second project of sorting algorithm
This new repository has two sorting algorithms: one is a classic sorting algorithm and the other is a quick sorting algorithm. It can be seen from 
the time difference between the two algorithms.

# Change values
In order to test this program on precise values, you have to change the values of `np.random.randint()`
